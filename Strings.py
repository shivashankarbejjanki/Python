# Strings
# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

# 'shiva' is the same as "shiva"

#You can use double or single quotes:

print("Hello")
print('Hello')

# Quotes Inside Quotes
# You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string;

# Example;
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'shiva'")
print('He is called "shiva"')
